Hello again :)

So I've burbled on a bit about Software Tools in Pascal, about regular expressions, and about the hoops of implementing them in late-70s vintage Pascal.

In the next half an hour or so, we're going to look at the same problem - this grep like pattern matcher - in C++, a Lisp, and JavaScript.

Ready?

Ok, hold tight.
