Now you might be thinking _that doesn't look like C++_, but it most assuredly does :)

To get started we've got the same basic shape as the Pascal. Grab the command line argument, compile it into a pattern, if the pattern matches the line splat it back out.

pattern.match <- here's our first real point of difference. Instead of a string, we've returned some kind of object.

Based on this tiny snippet, would anyone like to have a stab at what's going on here? What does a pattern object look like, or what's going inside match?
